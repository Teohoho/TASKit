Python scripts meant to be used in analysis of MD simulations. Current features are: 
* Generation of potential energy timeseries from MD, using OpenMM
* Trajectory decorrelation, using J. Chodera's PyMBAR library
* RMSD All-vs-All computation and generation of corresponding heatmap, using MDTraj
* Clusterization and extraction of representative structure, using SciPy
