Python scripts meant to be used in analysis of MD simulations. Current features are: 
	- generation of potential energy timeseries from MD, using OpenMM
	- trajectory decorrelation, using J. Chodera's PyMBAR library
	- RMSD All-vs-All computation and generation of corresponding heatmap, using MDTraj
	- Clusterization and extraction of representative structure, using SciPy
